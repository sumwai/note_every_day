# Note Every Day

English | [简体中文](README.md)

Hello, my name is cheng xiang wei, english name is sumwai. Yesterday, I deleted my all public repositories, because I found, I am not a coder, my repositories like children's toys. that make me look like a stupid guy. I usually clean up things that don't look clear, then restart.

The day before yesterday, I read [How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html),  and [Think like a git](https://think-like-a-git.net) by [@geeksam](https://github.com/geeksam/), suddenly i realized, I am a "lusers", I want to change myself, so, I created this repository.

In this repository, I want to record my every day. TODO, LEARNED THINGS, and THINK. at the same time, I will also take this opportunity to learn English, do my best, to translate note to english. I am pool at english, so, I will record my learned english part to [English.md](english.md), wish that can help you.
